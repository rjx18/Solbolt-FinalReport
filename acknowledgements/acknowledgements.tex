\section*{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to my
supervisor, Dr William Knottenbelt, for all his insightful advice and support throughout the year 
despite the current difficult circumstances.
I would also like to thank my second marker, Dr Maria Vigliotti,
for her assistance in helping to set the scope of this project.
Finally, I would like to thank those who have helped me with the technical details
of the Solidity compiler over at the Ethereum Gitter forum, for being so patient
and kind with my questions. I am incredibly proud to be able to complete my degree
with a project that I am keenly passionate about, and would love to work more on in the future.
